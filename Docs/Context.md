With traditional rendering approaches objects are represented by a mesh which is just a skin around the object. This means that the only way to edit this object is to warp the mesh to give the illusion of depth. This illusion is limited in its application and is not suited to scenarios that require a more detailed representation of depth, such as terrain manipulation. Voxels allow us to truly represent depth. While traditional approaches could be warped to create a crate or a mountain, voxels can be used to create archways and caves. There are two main ways of representing voxels: meshing and ray-casting. A simple implementation of both of these methods are very inefficient and cannot provide an acceptable level of quality at an acceptable framerate. This project aims to explore optimisations to show how they work and in which scenarios they should be used.
